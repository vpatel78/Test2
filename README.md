Test 2 Work

# Question 1
Create code that allows you to create an ordered list of tokens. This code should take in a file as input and process that file for the following lexemes:

#
Perl Style Identifiers that uses Dart style accessibility with the second character instead of the first – Scalar Variables
– Arrays
– Hash Maps


You may choose what ever symbol you represent for the special symbol but this must be explained in the comments with operation represents which symbol. Every type of lexeme defined must have a unique token equivalence. In this language every literal must be followed by white space or a special symbol to mark its end.

# Question 2
Write a C program that does a large number of references to elements of two-dimensioned arrays, using only subscripting. Write a second program that does the same operations but uses pointers and pointer arithmetic for the storage-mapping function to do the array references. Compare the time efficiency of the two programs. Which of the two programs is likely to be more reliable? Why?

# Question 3
Write a Perl program that uses a hash and a large number of operations on the hash. For example, the hash could store people’s names and their ages. A random-number generator could be used to create three-character names and ages, which could be added to the hash. When a duplicate name was generated, it would cause an access to the hash but not add a new element. Rewrite the same program without using hashes. Compare the execution efficiency of the two. Compare the ease of programming and readability of the two.

# Question 4
What features of the compilation process allow us to determine the reference environment for any at any given line of code in the program. Answer this question for both dynamic and static scoping? Does the type of scoping change this answer? Explain why?


# Question 5
Detail how you would go about adding reserved words into the problem where you are designing your own lexical analyzer? How would you have to change your code? What would you have to add to let users choose a reserve word word as an identifier?


# Question 6
Write a recursive decent algorithm for a java while statement, a Javas if statement , an logical/mathematical expression based on the rules you created in your lexical analyzer, and an mathe- matical assignment statement, where statement may be an empty function. Supply the EBNF rule for each.

# Question 7
Given the natural constraints of an RDA explain how you would go about the creation of a Statement function in your RDA that would allow statement to either be a while statement, an if statement or an assignment statement.

# Question 8
Write a JavaScript and Python script that has subprograms nested three deep and in which each nested subprogram references variables defined in all of its enclosing subprograms and also has variables used to hide at least 1 variable from a non-local function.
